# Portfolio

This is a rough draft of my portfolio website at Full Sail University.

##Deployment Plan

Once initial deployment of the portfolio has been launched, here are the steps to continue adding additional features of the website. 

*Merge development branch into Master*

One of the first steps of is to start merging the development branch into the master. Pull the remote master branch  to ensure the local master branch is up-to-date. Switch to the local master branch and from here pull the portfolio master branch to compare to the master on the remote deployment server.

If there is any inconsistencies and/or conflicts,
